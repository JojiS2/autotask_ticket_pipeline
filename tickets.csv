Sending this ticket in for tracking purposes. I got kicked out of Epic Production and Release and then when trying to get back in, I encountered the following error message when I tried to get back into Epic Production from the remote.ochin.info portal. I exited out of Citrix Workspace and tried again and still got the error below.
 
I was able to get back into Release just fine.
 
No immediate need to troubleshooting at this time. I will connect and try again tomorrow morning when I return to the office.

If improving throughput and capacity in the Emergency Department is on your radar, you won’t want to miss this upcoming webcast.



Join us on May 28 to hear from Toya Gorley, Improvement Advisor at NRC Health, and Sara Morris, MAM, RN, Director of Emergency Services and Capacity Management at Bryan Health.

You’ll get practical insights into what’s working, how to identify common barriers, and why multidisciplinary collaboration is essential to making sustainable progress.

Since there is no Lawrence BH Integrated department set up, her appointments were incorrectly placed in the Gleason House BH Integrated department. As a result, her patients were unable to be checked in properly.

We request that Maribel Arroyo be placed under the Primary Care Department and have her schedules opened there to prevent this issue from recurring until a BH Integrated department can be established.

Hi Rubi,



The 23 messages sent from Community Medical Centers Dixon on 5/13 were not accepted by CAIR because the CAIR account 48CMCDIXON did not have an EMR vendor relationship with OCHIN. The EMR vendor relationship was established today on 5/14.



Can you contact OCHIN support to retrigger the 23 messages from 5/13 and resend them to CAIR?



Thanks,

Thigh lighted buttons are the ones to use for nursing visits to submit charges through EPIC per Monica Casique (from the biller dept.). One the procedure button is greyed out; this should be available to all MAs to use. I was advised if theses options are not available, we are to reach out to applications and provide the MA names so they can make this available to use.
The upper codes, those are only to use for providers only.

She stated that a lot of the CPT codes are incorrect . She also let me know that they have received a lot of requisitions the past few days that say signed by CMCCA with no provider attached and they will be having to fax those back . They also do not have a location/POS number but here are their addresses ,phone numbers and fax numbers , if you can please add it to the refer to location/POS area

Attention Providers,

You are receiving this email because you are either transitioning from Scribe X or DAX/AI Temp, etc.

  1.
At your own pace, please log into your Ella environment and register for following course; DAX Copilot Provider Training- Ella
  2.
Once complete, please email Application indicating the completion of the following course.
  3.
Application will then proceed with issuing the appropriate licensing to begin using DAX/AI for scribing purposes.
  4.
For any questions or concerns, feel free to contact myself, Laura Vang or Dr. Morison.

                * Adjustments to temporary databases to improve performance

Can we look into his issue, please? The full description is below. There are two NPs here at Weberstown whose appointments are being moved by EPIC onto the RN's schedule if she has an appointment with the patient that same day. Please see her explanation below. Thank you.

Subject: Ticket for issue with Epic auto-cancelling appointments on provider schedule/moving them to RN schedule

Hi Matthew,

As we discussed - EPIC is moving all of my appointments that we are scheduling for patients onto the RN's schedule if she has an appointment with the patient that same day. The result is that instead of having 1 appt with me and 1 appt with the RN, the patient now has 2 appts with the RN and ZERO appts with me. This is also happening with Annie Thor's patients - any patient that has an appt with a provider and the RN same day (which is all patients who have NSTs)

I've included Minerva and Maria to see if there's a temporary workaround we can do for this problem while your team investigates why this is happening more. This is going to impact quite a few patients who are being seen weekly at Weberstown; those slots have already been filled by other patient appointments in the one example I'm giving you.

Hanna will have more examples if you need them, as she is the RN that coordinates our patients who need NSTs and is the one who originally caught this problem.

Thank you everybody!

Hello,



We have made some changes to the on-site support for tomorrow. Please pay close attention to the yellow highlighted staff that are being requested to support at another location. I have highlighted both their current site and their new site allocation.

Please reach out if you have any questions. As a friendly reminder please route all resource site changes to Tracey Enos and myself so that we can ensure proper communication is being provided to everyone here. (link below to live document should work as normal).



Big kudos to all of you doing a fantastic job out there!

Subject: Scheduling Issue for Maribel Arroyo, LCSW on 5/13/25
Importance: High

I was assisting Maribel Arroyo, LCSW, and we encountered an issue with her schedule on 5/13/25 while she was working out of Lawrence. Since there is no Lawrence BH Integrated department set up, her appointments were incorrectly placed in the Gleason House BH Integrated department. As a result, her patients were unable to be checked in properly.

We request that Maribel Arroyo be placed under the Primary Care Department and have her schedules opened there to prevent this issue from recurring until a BH Integrated department can be established.

Please see the example screenshot below.

Hi Katherine,



Thank you for this detailed email. I will forward it to the appropriate team. Hanna brought to my attention that it's also happening on Anne Thor's schedule as well so, they will have more than enough examples to figure out why it's happening. I'll keep you posted on the progress.

Subject: Ticket for issue with Epic auto-cancelling appointments on provider schedule/moving them to RN schedule



Hi Matthew,



As we discussed - EPIC is moving all of my appointments that we are scheduling for patients onto the RN's schedule if she has an appointment with the patient that same day. The result is that instead of having 1 appt with me and 1 appt with the RN, the patient now has 2 appts with the RN and ZERO appts with me. This is also happening with Annie Thor's patients - any patient that has an appt with a provider and the RN same day (which is all patients who have NSTs)



I've included Minerva and Maria to see if there's a temporary workaround we can do for this problem while your team investigates why this is happening more. This is going to impact quite a few patients who are being seen weekly at Weberstown; those slots have already been filled by other patient appointments in the one example I'm giving you.



Hanna will have more examples if you need them, as she is the RN that coordinates our patients who need NSTs and is the one who originally caught this problem.



Thank you everybody!

Hi Alma,

The list you provided only has the encounter number for the last one.

There was no billing for service. When I looked that the back end it looks like she started to fill out the NBE but never submitted it. Please have provider finalize NBE.


Encounter numbers are missing.

I looked up the rest by MRN, they have all been accepted. Please contact Apps Helpdesk to see how to resolve this.

Hello, I had some issues last week with sending medication through epic. Last Thursday I spoke with someone from the help desk that it was fixed. Today I am sending a non-controlled medication to the pharmacy but it shows me a message that says I am not set up as a e-prescribing provider.

When the provider orders vaccines, under immunization there is a TAB where we can choose the VIS (Vaccine Information Sheet). However, once you choose which vaccine you want the VIS printed out for, it is not there. Could you please fix this?

Subject: Referral Process
 

Hello Team, 

 

I was just made aware that our referrals are not being received by the specialty locations we are sending them to even though in our end it looks like they are being sent. The MA spoke to someone from SJGH and they stated that they have received maybe only 6 referrals today when they usually receive 60-70 a day from us. Can someone please help us with this.

She is off today, but will be working remote tomorrow. Can someone please assist?

Modern healthcare leaders need modern tools and the realm of employee feedback is no exception.



Join us on Tuesday, June 10, 2025 to see how you can move past ordinary methods used to collect employee feedback and develop practical, proactive methods to absorb, consider, and act on the information. We'll show you how to foster a culture of employee involvement, how to develop and strengthen leaders, and how other organizations are finding success with continuous listening.



Don’t miss this opportunity to gain actionable strategies that support a more connected and responsive workplace culture.

Hello,

We have made some changes to the on-site support for tomorrow. Please pay close attention to the yellow highlighted staff that are being requested to support at another location. I have highlighted both their current site and their new site allocation.
Please reach out if you have any questions. As a friendly reminder please route all resource site changes to Tracey Enos and myself so that we can ensure proper communication is being provided to everyone here. (link below to live document should work as normal).

Big kudos to all of you doing a fantastic job out there!

Subject: CMC Update On Epic Computer Migration 5-21-2025

CMC wanted to keep each of your organizations updated about our migration to the Epic  Ambulatory Practice Management System which occurred as scheduled on May 13, 2025
  The data conversion from Next Gen, Demographics,  E. H.R  & Future Schedules to our new Epic  system was successful. As planned it included  Next Gen data prior to April 7, 2025. This data has been saved to a special archive too.
 Also planned , Next Gen data from April 7 to our  day before  Go Live May 12 will be added to Epic  in early June.

In addition to the engagement of our entire 1000 CMC staff, especially the 25 Applications & Analyst staff, Ochin Epic last week had 18 experienced Epic  workflow  engineers and trainers  on site in San Joaquin & Solano to further  assist CMC staff in this transition .

On a gradual basis over the next 12 months your members who have been cared for since May 13, will be encouraged to sign up for  the Epic Patient Portal  My Chart, which will have many useful access features for your members.

Other transitional areas may come to our attention in the next few months , and if they do we have both our internal resources and ongoing external support from Ochin Epic to tackle area that may arise

Provider Schedules will be back to normal  starting May 27, 2025

CMC   is looking  forward to leveraging our new  Epic operational tools to improve community health and our organization's  effectiveness in the care we provide.

Also:

CMC have a All Staff All Sites meeting from 8am,-10:00am Thursday May 29th

Memorial Day May 26th:  Holiday Operating Schedule 8:00am- 4:30pm .  10 Centers Open. Services in  Stockton, Lodi, Manteca, Tracy & Vacaville

Today we had a CMC employee come in and receive her TB placement. We are unable to completely check her in due to the self-pay option not being there. We followed the process that was given to us. We selected Employee as Guarantor, and we are supposed to be able to select self-pay then check her in but we can't.

I did go into the zoom meeting and spoke to some OCHIN support staff and they also could not figure out why the option was not there. They suggested I submit a ticket.

Also, it states that I am a case manager/care coordinator, and I am a Health Coverage Counselor, not sure if that has anything to do with it the request of diagnosis codes. I have attempted to change the visit type to Eligibility (140) instead of Telehealth that has not worked, also visits with HCC's are non-billable so level of service is TX016. Please advise.

Hello,

My name is Rosie Fox, and I am a Behavioral Health Intern here at Community Medical Centers. I cannot find the Epic software on my work laptop, and I do not know how to access the platform in order to sign in.

If Epic could be installed onto my work laptop, or if someone can guide me on how to find the platform on my work laptop, I would really appreciate it. Thank you!

Sincerely,

The back-office leadership team is in charge of conducting referral audits for the referrals ordered by the providers. While doing this audit I noticed that many referrals have not been transferred from NextGen to EPIC. Is patient data still being merged into EPIC?

Fostering a culture of employee involvement is an important skillset for people leaders to develop and strengthen. That's why today's healthcare leaders must have modern tools that enable them to absorb, consider, and act on employee feedback.

Join us on June 10 to explore current approaches to continuous listening and learn a practical framework for people leaders to use as they appreciate, understand and decide how to address feedback in the workplace.

Department CMCCA VACA PEDS was created in EPIC to be used whenever our pediatric providers cover their rotational Saturday clinic (located in Vacaville 3rd floor - not Vacaville 210).  However, Scheduling Team is unable to open templates correctly since peds providers are not showing up under this department name.

Can we please ensure the following providers are linked to both CMCAA VACA PEDS  -and- CMCAA VACA 210 PEDS:


  *   Shami Prasad-Clerve, NP
  *   Nicholas Lerias, DO
  *   Luna Sharma, MD

*Flagged for urgency since NP listed above is supposed to cover Saturday clinic tomorrow, 5/24. All her patients are currently linked to the incorrect department.

My epic will not let me schedule this appointment for a patient because it is saying that I do not have access to override. I have tried booking this appointment under multiple different visit types for new patients but none of them appear to work. I attached a photo for reference.

This issue has happened with multiple different time slots on provider's schedules.

There is an option when trying to print a document in NextGen to save as PDF. We are gonna abuse this.

What is happening is that when you save a document within NextGen it's saving into the actual server you are connected to rather than into your own desktop. A neat thing we are going to abuse is that Remote Desktop allows us to grab files from within that server and take the file to our desktop a different way: through Copy and paste.

The idea is to save the document as a PDF and then go back to the print option and download AGAIN. When you do this, the pop up will show the desired document already saved as a PDF in whatever file you chose. Right click it and then copy the file. Go over to whatever file you have on desktop and paste it there and you'd have successfully transferred the file to your own PC!",2025-05-27T22:07:05.030Z,,2025-05-27T22:07:05.030Z,2025-06-04T16:07:05.030Z,,,,,1,,,2,5,230.0,3,T20250527.0028,1,NextGen - Trying to Download Documents,[]

Got in contact with Dr. Marashi and it turns out she is trying to print from Windows and not from Epic or NextGen. Unfortunately, the printers she has connected need to have their drivers reinstalled and I do not have the permissions to do that myself. I did escalate the issue to IS and they were able to help her out.

Thank you :)",2025-05-29T20:56:53.773Z,,2025-05-29T20:56:53.773Z,2025-06-05T20:55:01.340Z,,,,,1,,,4,5,318.0,3,T20250529.0005,1,Printer issues,[]

Good Morning,



I look at the SER record for each of those RDHAPs and they already have RDHAP in the ‘Credentials to display’ area. Please let me know if it is still now showing up for them.

Good morning!  Yes, this is set in the SER record.  Can you tell me a resident's name and I'll see where that is missing and let you know the exact SER item to update.  There are a few places that have clinician title/license for display.  I want to make sure I give the correct SER item to update ??.

We came across an MA note that we weren't able to complete due to having incomplete wild cards. Attached to the MA note was a referral that was ordered on 5/14/25.  We were assisted and informed that on epic 3 asterisk together are considered a wild card and should delete asterisk and leave 1 or 2 so epic doesn't consider it a wild card.

We just want to ensure that the patient is not getting alerts to come to E Main when this clinician is not here.

Pod 1- Family Med. The team shared with me this morning that they notice a lot of printing gets to come out as the provider closes their notes. The providers don't choose to print, as they're finishing their notes it prints out automatically.  An example is today- Dr. Damien is working remotely and as she's finishing her notes, it prints here. 

This issue has been noted only on Printer from Pod. 1. Could it be a mapping issue?  If you can please look into this matter. We appreciate your assistance. 



This happening to Dr. Binaca Hebbard as soon as she orders labs or imaging.

Subject: Pod 1- Family Med. Printer

Hello Team, Hoping your day is going well.

Pod 1- Family Med. The team shared with me this morning that they notice a lot of printing gets to come out as the provider closes their notes. The providers don't choose to print, as they're finishing their notes it prints out automatically.  An example is today- Dr. Damien is working remotely and as she's finishing her notes, it prints here.
This issue has been noted only on Printer from Pod. 1. Could it be a mapping issue?  If you can please look into this matter. We appreciate your assistance.


Thank you,

Good afternoon Kevin, 


I am currently having an issue with a referral that was ordered but never generated on 5/1/25 when we were still on NextGen. The patient is supposed to come in for an appt tomorrow at 3:45. According to Xochitl (referral Supervisor) we would need the referral abstracted into EPIC. Would you be able to assist with the abstraction for this referral.

We noticed that Hanna Hau does not have her title next to her name.
[cid:a45837ab-7547-43cb-af70-316854b31644]

Could this be causing confusion to some team members? Lately, she's been having patients for iup f/u, or for breast pain.
Hanna is constantly correcting team members and asking them to r/s these appts with a medical provider.
I contacted our Scheduling dept. for this issue, however they referred me to the Apps team.

Thank you,
